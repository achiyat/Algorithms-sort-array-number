## 📖 Introduction
A sort algorithm organizes elements in a data structure into a specific order (ascending or descending), enabling efficient data handling. Key factors include time and space complexity, with different algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort using various strategies to achieve sorting based on their efficiency and suitability for different data sizes and types.

##  📋 Task Description
You are given a number sequence that contains positive integers and zeros. The sequence can be split into zero-terminated sub-sequences. Each sub-sequence should be sorted in ascending order (excluding the zero, which remains at the end), and then all sub-sequences should be sorted by their sum values in ascending order. If multiple sub-sequences have the same sum, they should retain their original order.

## 🎯 The Task
Your task is: 
First, sort each sub sequence according to the ascending order (don't sort the zero, it always at the end); 
Second, sort all sub sequence according to their sum value (ascending order too).

**📝 Result:** The result is the sorted number sequence.

**🔔 Note:** If some sub sequences have the same sum value, sort them according to their original order.

**🔍 For example:**

```bash
sortSequence([3,2,1,0,5,6,4,0,1,5,3,0,4,2,8,0]) should return [1,2,3,0,1,3,5,0,2,4,8,0,4,5,6,0]
sortSequence([3,2,1,0,5,6,4,0,1,5,3,0,2,2,2,0]) should return [1,2,3,0,2,2,2,0,1,3,5,0,4,5,6,0]
sortSequence([2,2,2,0,5,6,4,0,1,5,3,0,3,2,1,0]) should return [2,2,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,3,5,0,4,5,6,0]
```

## ✨ Features
- Sorting sub-sequences based on ascending order.
- Sorting sub-sequences based on sum values in ascending order.
- Preserving original order of sub-sequences with the same sum.
